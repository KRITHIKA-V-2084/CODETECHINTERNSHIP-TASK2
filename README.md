### **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:**

**PROJECT :** STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

**OBJECTIVE:**
The objective of the code is to create a Python program that tracks and manages student grades. The program allows the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, determines the corresponding letter grade and GPA, and displays a summary of the student's performance. This includes detailed information for each subject, the overall average grade, the letter grade, and the GPA, providing a comprehensive overview of the student's academic standing.

**KEY FEATURES:**
The key features of the code are:

1) User-Friendly Interface:

- Prompts for subject names and grades.
- Allows the user to enter multiple grades and stop when desired by typing 'done'.

2) Input Validation:

- Ensures that the grades entered are numeric values.
- Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to re-enter the grade if necessary.

3) Grade Calculation:

- Calculates the average grade from the entered grades.

4) Grade Conversion:

- Converts the numeric average grade to a corresponding letter grade based on a standard scale (A, B, C, D, F).
- Converts the letter grade to a GPA value based on a standard 4.0 scale.

5) Summary Display:

- Displays a summary of all entered subjects and grades.
- Shows the calculated average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a clear format.

6) Input Collection and Validation:

- Continuously collects subject names and grades until the user finishes.
- Ensures grades are valid numeric values.

7) Calculation Functions:

- get_letter_grade(average): Determines the letter grade from the numeric average.
- get_gpa(letter_grade): Converts the letter grade to the GPA.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

The above code uses the following technologies and features of the Python programming language:

- Python Programming Language: The entire program is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and ease of use.

1) Standard Input/Output:

- input(): Used to gather input from the user for subjects and grades.
- print(): Used to display messages, prompts, and the summary of grades and calculations to the user.

2) Data Structures:

- Lists: Used to store the subjects and corresponding grades.
'
3) Control Structures:

- Loops: while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they type 'done'.
- Conditional Statements: if, elif, and else statements to handle different grade ranges and validate input.

4) Functions:

- get_letter_grade(average): Converts a numeric average grade to a letter grade.
- get_gpa(letter_grade): Converts a letter grade to a GPA value.
- main(): The main function that orchestrates the overall flow of the program, handling input, processing, and output.

5) Error Handling:

- Try/Except Block: Used to catch and handle ValueError exceptions when non-numeric input is provided for grades, ensuring the program doesn't crash and provides a user-friendly error message.
