### **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:**

**PROJECT :** STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
**OBJECTIVE:**
The objective of the code is to create a Python program that tracks and manages student grades. The program allows the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, determines the corresponding letter grade and GPA, and displays a summary of the student's performance. This includes detailed information for each subject, the overall average grade, the letter grade, and the GPA, providing a comprehensive overview of the student's academic standing.

**KEY FEATURES:**
The key features of the code are:

1) User-Friendly Interface:

- Prompts for subject names and grades.
- Allows the user to enter multiple grades and stop when desired by typing 'done'.

2) Input Validation:

- Ensures that the grades entered are numeric values.
- Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to re-enter the grade if necessary.

3) Grade Calculation:

- Calculates the average grade from the entered grades.

4) Grade Conversion:

- Converts the numeric average grade to a corresponding letter grade based on a standard scale (A, B, C, D, F).
- Converts the letter grade to a GPA value based on a standard 4.0 scale.

5) Summary Display:

- Displays a summary of all entered subjects and grades.
- Shows the calculated average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a clear format.

6) Input Collection and Validation:

- Continuously collects subject names and grades until the user finishes.
- Ensures grades are valid numeric values.

7) Calculation Functions:

- get_letter_grade(average): Determines the letter grade from the numeric average.
- get_gpa(letter_grade): Converts the letter grade to the GPA.
